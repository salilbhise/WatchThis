# Project 1 Concept: "WatchThis!"

Users interact with the app through a series of questions that narrow down what they should watch using The Movie DB API. Questions will include categories like Show/Movie, Genre, Decade, etc. We will use GIPHY API on the results page to add gifs related to their movie or show, and include a field to submit their email for future login and list builder.
