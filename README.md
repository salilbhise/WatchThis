## WatchThis! :tv:

An application using JSON data from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API that helps users choose a  Show or Movie to watch quickly and efficiently based off answers provided in a fun little survey. Our solution takes the trouble out of finding something to watch when it's time to #netflixandchill.
