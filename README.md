# Project 1

## WatchThis!

An application using JSON data from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API that helps users choose a Movie or TV Show quickly and efficiently based off answers provided in a fun little survey. We take the trouble out of finding something to watch when it's time to #netflixandchill.  

## Technology and Concepts 
User Input Validation, The Movie DB API, Giphy API, AJAX, Bootstrap
